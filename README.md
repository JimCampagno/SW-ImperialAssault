**Follow these steps.**

1. Click this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDZa6SdnAgo) and listen to the beautiful sounds as you continue to read the following instructions.

2. Read the rule book [here](https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/84/fc/84fcff54-eafe-45ec-acf4-538a86e1acfc/imperial_assault_learn_to_play_guide.pdf). Feel free to continue listening to Star Wars music as you read these rules. If you're not a fan of reading, you can watch someone on YouTube go through the rules [here](https://youtu.be/sCXZfZSDTvw
) (although I recommend reading the book as well!)


3. You don't need to read all the way through the [rules reference guide](https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/ef/86/ef866943-534b-429e-b8db-7d99875431b7/imperial_assault_rules_reference_guide.pdf). But I think it's important to skim through some parts of it to clarify any questions you might have. 

4. Skim through the [FAQ](https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/4c/be/4cbe8a20-4066-4348-ab6f-f9d0d45bd8c1/swi_faq_v22.pdf).

5. No action items required for you here. But to get a sense as to how we keep track of everything, click [this](https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/61/d5/61d51b57-523e-4413-9a3b-884d145a1af4/campaignlog.pdf).
